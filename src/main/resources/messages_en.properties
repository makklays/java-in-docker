history.paragraf_1=It is <b>2118</b>. You are the Captain of the colony with the mission <b>«Pact 5 stars»</b>, to preserve human civilization from Spain, to develop life on the Moon, based on the spiritual and moral code - the Pact of Humanity and the Memory of the Ancestors of the Third Planet from the Sun in the Constellation of the Milky Way.
history.paragraf_2=After escaping a dying Earth where all major Earth cities have been destroyed, you and your team are given the opportunity to carry out the mission «Pact 5 stars» - humanity's last hope for survival. The mission departed from Madrid, Spain, with the hope of male offspring and its continuation, with the hope of an heir. Although they are now far from Earth, Earth still sends signals and words that can be heard in space.
history.paragraf_3=You are the founder of a colony on the surface of the Moon near the Copernicus crater. It is here that a powerful energy anomaly and possible extraction of the main resources necessary for the construction and development of the colony are located. You need water, plastic, food, iron and other related resources and items. You started from scratch - under the banner of the Pact of Spain: Justice, Memory, Freedom and Faith in the Future. It is from here that the best minds are sent - and you command them.
history.paragraf_4=In 2118, researchers Gromozeka and Alisa recorded unknown signals from the dark side of the Moon - from the Weber-9 crater, long considered a dead zone. After the founding of the colony, a race of aliens emerged from its depths - an alien civilization that had been hiding in the underground layers for thousands of years, in cryogenic hives. Their structure and development differed from human ones.
history.paragraf_5=They didn't come from another star in space - they were always here, deep inside the dark side of the Moon, after its ancient catastrophe. They are fed by strange fluctuations in the gravitational fields of the Earth and the Sun. They didn't know about humans until the construction of a human colony upset the balance of signals, awakening them. They began to build their colony and develop their alien race. They are typical aliens, green and big-headed. Now they see humans as a threat to the stability of the planet and offer one thing: retreat - or disappear.
history.paragraf_6=People carry the Pact, soul, feelings, love. Aliens are pure mathematics of survival in long-term efficiency.
history.paragraf_7=You are the captain of a new colony with the mission «Pact 5 stars». Your goal and mission is to build a new, prosperous colony for the survival and continuation of the human race in space with an heir. Your crew helps you with this and makes suggestions. You are torn between the need to protect people and the realization that conflict with aliens can forever destroy the possibility of a peaceful future. You are the captain who stands between the machine of the mind and the living heart of humanity.
history.paragraf_8=Reveal the secret of the moon and space. <br/>The secret of the origin of mankind and the space races of other planets. <br/>Reveal the secret of the origin of space and life in it.
history.paragraf_9=The aliens demand that the construction be stopped: according to their stories, people are building on the ashes of their dead ancestors, and this is sacrilege. Captain Green suggests attacking and fighting back the enemy. Alisa suggests finding a compromise. Gromozeka suggests studying the artifacts and proving that both races originated from the same ancient ashes.

history.personaje_1=<b>Alice</b> — is a specialist in space biology and cultural navigation. She was the first to come into contact with aliens and notes that they have cultural immunity against humans - they do not forgive mistakes.</br> Alice has a milophone that allows her to hear the thoughts of all space creatures.
history.personaje_2=<b>Captain Green</b> — Former member of the United Expeditionary Force. War veteran, straightforward, ready to defend the colony at all costs. His opinion: "Build first, solve later."
history.personaje_3=<b>Gromozeka</b> — mechanical engineer and astronaut archaeologist. He specializes in ancient alien structures. He says, “These ruins are silent, but they will tell you a lot – if you know how to listen.” Gromozeka is also deeply religious; he considers the Moon “the place of the Testament of all civilizations, which all life on Earth has seen.”
history.personaje_4=<b>KT-9 Android</b> — Android robot KT-9. He, as well as robots of other models, are the combat and defense units of the new colony.
